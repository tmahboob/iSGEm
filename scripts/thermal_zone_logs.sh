#This script is designed to monitor and log the temperature of each CPU thermal zone on the system. 
#It reads temperature data from the /sys/class/thermal directory, where the thermal zones for each CPU core are located. 
#The script runs in a loop for 20 minutes, recording the temperature of each thermal zone every 200 milliseconds. 
#Each reading is timestamped and appended to a log file located at /root/logs/cpu_temp_log.txt. 
#The temperature values are converted from millidegrees Celsius to degrees Celsius for better readability.
# After the 20-minute duration, the script terminates, signaling the completion of the data collection process.
